### Part 2: Hero Section Critique of [Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca)

Website Summary:
- Best Buy is a provider of technology products and services. Their target audience are mostly tech savy individuals who prefer to have the latest and greatest tech gear. Best Buy's website provides consumers with a quick and reliable way to shop for their technology needs.

Call to Action (CTA) critique:

<strong> First CTA: </strong>
 - Best Buy's CTA does its job but in my opinion it is <mark> not effective </mark>. 
  - The CTA is placed in the middle of the home page which helps add attention to it. They do a great job at representing their brand colours with different blue hues but in my opinion it seems a bit overbearing due to the lack of contrast/differentiation from their header. It could be improved by removing the "blue" background of their CTA to offer a minimalist look. 
 - The fact that the "shop now" button's background is the same as the text just makes it blend into the text which prevents it from standing out.

<strong> Second CTA: </strong>
 - Their second CTA, which can be found just by scrolling down seems to be more effective at drawing attention. It is clearly defined due to the contrast with the site's background while showcasing different types of merchandise on sale at a glance.
  - Above their CTA, is an area that exhibits categories of merchadise which is a great example of minimizing cognitive load for their consumers
